            <h1>who am I?</h1>
            <p>I am a female born on the twenty-eighth of march, 2005, and I have a passion for art and coding.
                I plan on developing my skills and further studying code to make it my career, and I want to be
                a game developer in the future. As for art, specifically digital painting, it will remain a hobby
                practiced outside of work, but in the off chance that I cannot become a game developer or work in
                something regarding media production, I'll freelance as a digital illustrator.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have a cat named Oscar that I have had for about a year by now, and he's one and a half years
                old. His birthday happens to fall on mine!
                <br>
                <br>
                My other interests mostly focus on creativity, like knitting, sewing, reading, and the list goes on.
                I like to go outside on walks and to sit by lakes and trees, and being at home brings me as much joy.

        <h2>Why I have chosen the IM line</h2>
        <p>In eighth grade, I got programming as my subject of choice, and we learned how to make a website.
            I found it to be really fun and I knew I wanted to work more with it. What I found fun about it
            that code is like puzzle pieces, you put them together to form your goal. It is always satisfying
            to see the final result at the end, to see all the effort you put into it paying off.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="proper" id="unique">
        <h2>Previous work experience</h2>
        <p>I worked as a coding instructor for fourth graders for two years, teaching me patience and how to work
            with others. It also taught me how to solve a problem in many ways as not all the kids i instructer
            were the same.<br>
            I also worked on a farm for two weeks and I learned to be a hard worker and be honest about
            my work. It was no easy work and it made me appreciate all those who had similar jobs.

        <div class="WAI-list">
            <div class="WAI-list-element"><b>Patient</b><br>I can work on a project for long period of times, and I can start it over if it isn't to my liking.</div>
            <div class="WAI-list-element"><b>Independent</b><br>I can handle a task on my own. I can work in teams as well but usually I thrive when I am on my own.</div>
            <div class="WAI-list-element"><b>Flexible</b><br>I can adjust to short-term change effectively, dealing with unexpected problems calmly and quickly.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="last-text">My goal in the future is to be financially stable and have a happy life. I would either work under someone,
            freelance, or work for myself, every option sounds good, but most likely it will be related to game development.
            As stated before however, if that doesn't end up being the path I take, I have many other options to choose from.</div>
