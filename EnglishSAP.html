<h1 class="SAP-header">Sketches And Plans</h1>
    <div class="rows">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="first-paras-SAP">There was quite the pressure on making a plan from the teachers,
                stressing how important it was for time management, and I agree, it does help with structuring
                one's time. I put some thoughts into my plan, thinking of the logical time to give each section
                of the work, and I ended up with the picture to the right. It seemed reasonable, and like a plan
                I could follow.
            </div>
            <div class="SAP-images"><img src="images/Timeplan1.jpg" alt="" class="image"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="first-paras-SAP">But I quickly ditched the plan. I ended up finishing some thinngs quicker,
                I didn't make a second sketch as I detailed the first. Eventually, I saw that there would be more
                coding than I had anticipated, and many problems halted my progress (but thankfully they were fixed
                eventually).
                <br>
                <br>
                I planned on making the website mobile-friendly and planned how it would look without
                sketching that down, but that was scraped as a week to the deadline, I wasn't that close to finishing
                the making of the website. The logo was done in the last week, same to the design manual and most of
                the text of the website along with the translations. It was a lot of work, but thankfully it was done
                before the deadline.
                <br>

                The picture to the right is how I ended up spending my time.

        <div class="text-middle">This is the sketch made for the sites. Very vague and it had just the layout, and
            despite it being nice-looking, it created problems of my own causing later as because of my vagueness,
            I forgot what I planned originally and had to improvise some of the times. I learned my lesson.

            Note: the design manual sketch was not made as the sketch was made before we learned what a design manual was.
