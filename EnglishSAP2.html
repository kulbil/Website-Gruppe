            The second semester was very different from the first, to no one's surprise. During the second semester, we learned JavaScript, which provided us with more possibilities to enhance our websites that we were not aware of before. My work flow changed, I took what I learned from the first semester and incorporated it into the second semester, mainly my way of planning. Instead of assigning each task time, I written all my tasks and marked which could be done easily and which needed research and a lot of time (this also helped when it came in regards of my energy levels, it was nice to have something easy to work on when I was not motivated.) <br>
            Down below is all my notes during the semester.

            <div class="first-paras-SAP">I had a lot of hope for this semester. I wrote everything down, planned on bringing back old ideas (for example my resposive layout for mobile phones), and to the right, you can see the list I created of the tasks I had to do, and I marked them upon what needs to be done first (the colours [red, yellow, green]), and the time and effort that needs to be put into them (orange shapes, the more corners they had, the harder the task was). I had even planned on leaving easter eggs if I got the time. <br> <br>
                I had managed to complete most of my tasks, but some needed to be abandoned as I did not have enough time. One of the main tasks I had to drop was the video about myself. It was not that I ditched it, I had actually filmed the entire thing in both English and Norwegian, but what I got to see the video files, I found out that they lacked audio. The first four minutes had audio, but it suddenly cuts off for seemingly no reason. <br>
                I did not let that kill my spirits, and while i was recording the voice over for the IP-address video, I recorded voice over instead of the deleted audios. However, even then, when it came time edit the video, I could not because surprise surprise, it had no audio and I had no idea what I was saying to sync the audio with the video. By then I had only a couple of days left until the deadline, and I did not have the time to record everything again. <br>
                What you see below is the script and the small storyboard that I made for the video.

        <div class="row first-paras-SAP" style="margin-top:100px;">
            Of course, that was not the only thing that I did not have time to do, but at least that was not required of our task. I wanted to changed the Home website and give it a more appealing layout. I was not able to create it due to the lack of time, but I have skectched the layout.

        </div>
        <div class="row first-paras-SAP" style="margin-top:100px;">
            My portfolio was another thing I wanted to change, and I got my main idea to work out while I left the rest. The portfolio completely changed, and now it is devided into tabs that one can click to check out each differnt part of my portfolio.

        </div>
        <div class="row first-paras-SAP" style="margin-top:100px;">
            Of course, there we new websites added, like the "computer and network" website and sketches and plans for the second semester. The meny had been changed accordingly to suit them. <br> <br>
            Overall, many changes occured, mostly for the better, and I have became a better coder (and my method and style of coding has changed as well.) I do these as positive changes, and while I am ambitious and placed higher goals than the task had given us, and it had led to some problem if I had to be truthful, it is also something I can use to my advantage and one that had shaped and built this website to what it became. The making of this project was quite the ride, a very new and fun one, and I look towards the future and what it holds for me.
